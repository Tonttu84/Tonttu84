## Hi there 

Im Johannes, an aspiring sofware developer from Hive Helsinki. I enjoy games, game development and low level languages. 👋

Currently Im a believer in OOP style modular coding where you have well defined APIs and clear division of tasks. 
It keep things simple and limits the context you need to understand which is important for both Humans and AI. 

I have mostly worked with C and CPP but I do hope to expand my skillset to other tools and languages. 

Im currently looking for work/internship. 
You can reach me at tonttu.tovinen22@gmail.com
